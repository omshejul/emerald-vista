          I stayed here for 2 weeks I must
          say i like that location near the high way...The staff are very kind
          and the place is safe ...The problem we had was that the ac had water
          leaked on it so in the morning the floor was always wet.. ... But
          overall, that place is ok for me, I will stay there again if ever I
          have a chance to visit India again ....ü§ó‚ù§ from Philippines üáµüá≠"/>

It doesn't feel like a typical room; it resembles a one BHK house. Within the room, there's a small hall with a mounted TV, a kitchen setup for making tea or coffee, and a bedroom with lockers and a study table. They offer many features within the room. The staff is also very friendly and accommodating. Despite not knowing Hindi, I didn't face any difficulties in requesting services as the staff understands our thoughts well. I highly recommend staying here if you're in the Baner area of Pune
